# sample-spring-hibernate

## Purpose

### Question:
What is the purpose of this project?

### Answer:
#### Main
* Main Application run's a Spring Application which picks up all rest controllers
* The HelloController (a RestController class) exposes two api's ('/hi/{id}' and '/all')
* The AccountService (a Service class) uses a JpaRepository to perform CRUD operations
* The AccountService class uses the Account class as an Entity class
* The Account (an Entity class) matches each of it's member variables to a table, table must be named the same as the class
* The AccountRepository (a Repository interface) extends the JpaRepository interface and provides default CRUD operations
* The controllers need to allow cross origin requests in order to make calls to the API's
* Added a Logger to the Home Controller

#### Test
* Under main/resources, the application.properties allows h2 logging to console
* Under main/resources, the import.sql is automatically executed by hibernate
* Under src/test/java, two tests for service and controller
* The controller test uses TestRestTemplate to perform a get and assert on the content to the URL
* The Service test checks to see that the data is present after hibernate runs the import.sql under main/java/resource

## Dependencies
* This project assumes that postgresql://localhost:5432/db is available
* This project assumes that the docker container found at https://github.com/msuddin/sample-postgress-docker is running locally

## Instructions
From the root directory of the project, run the command below to run the tests and build the jar:
```
./gradlew clean build
```
Now let's run the jar:
```
ava -jar build/libs/<jar_name>.jar
```
The application should now start-up.

## API Endpoints
### /hi
You can make a curl below that does not connect to any db and just prints a string:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/hi
```
Output should be:
```
application says hi
```
### /hi/{id}
You can curl to get just one of the records:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/hi/1
```
Output should be:
